simple game 
Lets start

No need modules and big testing skills just simple stuffs
Start By adding a index.html file to the directory you are working on

while we implement we need the lates cdns for the build so we to grab them
	Visit React CDN	https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react
	Visit Underscore.js CDN https://cdnjs.com/libraries/underscore.js/
	Visit Babel CDN for Browser.js that transpiles to ES6 and latest
Alright

App Logic
	There is a board.js app and Go.js app
	It is best if we seperate both App and Presentation Logic In to different JS files
	Board .js is a pure vanilla js app that is build pure in javascript
